TODO:
	Do a full code review
	Allow Relic/Equipment to be resized
	Refactor or Confirm Functionality of Fullscreen mode
	Remove or find use for Tray Popup
		Potentially push functions into tray icon

	Get Name Plaques working again
	Move all colors into the Picker/Settings
	Add Owned indicator to Overlays
	Store settings in appdata as json
	Fix Overlay white flash
	Confirm Eqmt window is being updated
	Move status into a bottom bar with text
		Makes it clearer and will work for colorblind people
	Look into potential of merging all windows into one?
		Possible, but unlikely?
		Need to consider usefulness
	Add tabs to main window
		Have status tab showing databases AND a "reload" button for each
		Have another tab for information, like the tray info
		Need to consider if tabs are worthwhile
			Or just to expand main window
	Get window hiding before tray icon shows
	Enabled clicking through the overlays
	Add in other languages
