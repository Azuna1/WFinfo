# Description


WFInfo V9 is a companion app for Warframe, based on the [original](https://github.com/Schwaxx/WFInfo) which is no being longer developed. 
WFinfo is designed to fix a missing feature from Warframe: quick access to both Platinum and Ducat prices when selecting a fissure reward.

WFinfo provides recent platinum values from warframe.market of every primed item. This is accomplished all without affecting Warframe in any way. 

# Features

### Fissure Prices

![Fissure Prices](https://i.imgur.com/Fl2z7qS.png)

To get the platinum prices during a fissure reward screen, press the activation hotkey (Print Screen by default) during the reward screen. 
The Platinum and Ducat prices will then be displayed either over Warframe itself or shown in a window that can be viewed on a second screen. 

To simplify operation, we've added Auto Mode, which will wait till Warframe says it "Got rewards" in the EE.log. Once it detects that message, it will look for the rewards screen and trigger the key for you. If it can't find the screen in five seconds, it will give up. At any point, you can trigger it yourself, if the Auto Mode isn't finding the screen.

### Relic Panel

The Relics panel allows you to look at all relics and see statistics for each. We show basic info such as whether a relic is vaulted and the relic's rewards and the rarities of those rewards, and we have three complex statistics for every relic:
1. The average platinum price of an Intact relic's rewards, which are based on drop chance.
1. The average platinum price of a Radiant relic's rewards, which are as well.
1. The difference between the two above values, which can be used to find which relics will give you more plat, on average, when refined.

### Equipment Panel

The Equipment window allows you to look at each prime equipment and its parts. It shows how much each costs currently on warframe.market, and also shows how much it will cost to purchase a whole set of equipment. You also can mark items that you own, and it will adjust the total cost to only the remaining items.

##### Note: For both of these info panels, there are several sorting options that allow you to find what is best for you. Also they have grouping features that allow you to see and sort all relics, or to only sort from one era, i.e. Lith.

# Usage

1. Download the latest release from [latest release](https://github.com/random-facades/WFInfo/releases).
1. Run the .exe file.
1. Configure by clicking the cog icon in the lower right.
1. Press the hotkey on a fissure mission's reward screen (Or wait if set to auto)
1. An overlay will appear or a second window will appear with the info.
